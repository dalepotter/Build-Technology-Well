A repository to provide non-judgmental guidance on building technology within non-technical organisations and startups.

This repository takes inspiration from sites such as https://choosealicense.com, and seeks to offer straightforward, easy-to-understand advice on creating scalable, maintainable technical assets in environments where there may be limited pre-existing technical knowledge.

See the [issues log](https://github.com/dalepotter/Build-Technology-Well/issues) for lists of current #TODOs and enhancements.
